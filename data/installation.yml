  docs: |

    To install Emblem on a Rails 3 project, just use add the following lines to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle`.

    Define your templates in `app/assets/javascripts/templates` with the file extension `.emblem`. These will be automatically compiled and made available as Ember templates. Templates with the `.raw.emblem` extension will be compiled as vanilla Handlebars templates.

    For a working sample project, check out:<br>[github.com/machty/emblem-rails-demo](https://github.com/machty/emblem-rails-demo)

  shell: |
    # Step 1: edit your application's Gemfile
    gem 'ember-rails'
    gem 'emblem-rails'

    # Optional, use the older pre4 version of ember (the default is rc1)
    #gem 'ember-source', '1.0.0.pre4.2'

    # Step 2: rebundle and restart your dev server
    bundle

    # Step 3: create your .emblem templates in app/assets/javascripts/templates/


# HTML / Javascript

  title: Inline HTML / Javascript
  docs: |
    You can easily test Emblem in the browser (works great for sites like jsbin.com) by just including the Emblem compiler script and wrapping your Emblem templates with `<script type="text/x-emblem">`.

    Your emblem script tags can also include `data-template-name` similar to inline Handlebars templates.

    See a working JSBin [demo here](http://jsbin.com/ulegec/17/edit).

    <!-- Step 1: Add Emblem.js -->

    <script type="text/x-emblem" data-template-name="application">
      h1 Welcome to my App
      = outlet
    </script>
